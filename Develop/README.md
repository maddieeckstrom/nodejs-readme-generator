  # nodejs-readme-generator

  ## Description

  This application was created to demonstrate how to generate files through the terminal, using a README as the example. Creating a README through the terminal may make the process easier for beginners, as the user will be given a series of set questions to respond to, generating a README that includes all the proper information without having to memorize it. In doing this project, I improved my knowledge on the use of inquirer.
